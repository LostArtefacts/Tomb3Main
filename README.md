# Tomb3Main

This is a project aiming at reverse engineering the classic Tomb Raider III
game with the hope of eventually becoming a fully open source implementation.

## Current road map

~~Reverse engineer the game, ahoy!~~  
This project is **abandoned** :bone:. Make sure to check out Troye's [TOMB3](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/tomb3), a project with similar mission.

Progress:
